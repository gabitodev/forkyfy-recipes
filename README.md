# Forkyfy
### A website to search recipes for you cooking needs.
#### In order to build this website I used HTML5 + CSS + Modern JavaScript(ES6 & WebPack).

##### The functions that you can do with this app are:

**1.** Look for any food to get the recipes.

**2.** See how many ingredients you need per serving.

**3.** Increase or decrease the amount of servings.

**4.** Add the ingredients to a shopping list where data is stored in the browser.

**5.** Give like or not to the recipe to save it in the data search engine.

This is posible thanks to data fetched from [Food2Fork API](https://food2fork.com/about/api). 

This project has been design by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. Coded & modified by me(**Gabriel Garcia**).
